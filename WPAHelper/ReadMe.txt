    MDLProjectWizard : "WPAHelper" Project Overview
========================================================================

MDLProjectWizard has created this "WPAHelper" project for you as a starting point.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your project.

MDLProjectWizard.vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of the product that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Sample.txt
This is a sample template file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes: This sample application code can be used as a template for development in 
MicroStation.

THIS Application needs to be built with VS2005 Only!  it uses an iterator
that comes from a Bentley Library that we remove (or potentially remove ) 
elements from.  This will cause a memory exception if not built with the same
VC library as Bentley.
